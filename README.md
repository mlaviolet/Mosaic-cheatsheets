# Mosaic-cheatsheets
RStudio-style cheatsheets for the mosaic package

The `mosaic` package is designed to facilitate the use of R in statistics and calculus instruction by providing a number of functions that 
* make many common tasks fit into a common template
* simplify some tasks that would otherwise be too complicated for beginners.
