# RStudio-style cheatsheets for the `mosaic` package

The `mosaic` package is designed to facilitate the use of R in statistics and calculus instruction by providing a number of functions that 
* make many common tasks fit into a common template.
* simplify some tasks that would otherwise be too complicated for beginners.

This page contains cheat sheets that make learning about and using `mosaic` easier. You'll find
* [PDF](https://github.com/mlaviolet/Mosaic-cheatsheets/blob/master/mosaic-cheatsheet-gf.pdf) and [source PowerPoint](https://github.com/mlaviolet/Mosaic-cheatsheets/blob/master/mosaic-cheatsheet-gf.pptx) with graphics using `ggformula`, as now recommended by the developers of `mosaic`.
* [PDF](https://github.com/mlaviolet/Mosaic-cheatsheets/blob/master/mosaic-cheatsheet-lattice.pdf) and [source PowerPoint](https://github.com/mlaviolet/Mosaic-cheatsheets/blob/master/mosaic-cheatsheet-lattice.pptx) with graphics using the older `lattice` package.

The cheat sheets are adapted from the *Student's Guide to R* by Horton, Pruim, and Kaplan, in [`ggformula`](https://github.com/ProjectMOSAIC/LittleBooks/blob/master/StudentGuide/MOSAIC-StudentGuide.pdf) and [`lattice`](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Horton+Pruim+Kaplan_MOSAIC-StudentGuide.pdf) versions. 

You can find out more about Project MOSAIC at [http://mosaic-web.org]. Also see [OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/) for inexpensive textbooks that work well with `mosaic`, and other resources.
